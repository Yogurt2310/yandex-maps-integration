So, hello everyone!
Recently I was interested in tourism. When I started to travel, I ran into all problems of this kind of time spending...
And cause of that I started to learn about some resources, which can help me to solve some kind of problems. I tried to make an interactive map,
which can get directions between some places in order of it's choosing. I picked up Yandex Maps API and started to learn it.
After time I made this project. I called it Easyway. Also I added some information about any sights.


If you want to use this project as start of something yours - add your API key(which you can take from Yandex), add your voice speech for information about sights and add video instructiion.
In this project you can find, where you need to place it.

Thanks for attention!
